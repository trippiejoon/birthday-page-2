  <p>Firstly, Happy 19th Birthday! Today's a day all about you. Hoping you get to celebrate in your most favorite way possible!</p>
  <p>Secondly, The person that sent me to deliver this message wanted me to tell you how much she loves you and is so so proud of the person you're becoming! Wow Kiki, you must make them super happy!</p>
  <p>Lastly, I know growing up is sometimes hard to think about. Missing the old times in life can make us feel sad to reminisce about. Its okay to be sad and feel this way. Its normal and valid! Even Hello Kitty gets sad thinking about growing up sometimes :(( but helps me face those fears is thinking of all the accomplishments and milestones I'll complete as I grow older. These are things that bring excitiment that you could share with loved ones! Im sure you'll go on to do great things and make everyone around you proud.Both near and far! From what Abida tells me, YOU'RE A SUPERSTAR!</p>
